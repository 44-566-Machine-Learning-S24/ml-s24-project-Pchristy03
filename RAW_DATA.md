#### Acquiring my data

To select my data I wanted to find a dataset that had numerous features and that appeared to be genuine. I ended up cutting out the top two because they lacked in key information such as transactions dates or they seemed to be completely fake. For example the adult income dataset had information from exactly 66% males and 33% females. Because of that I decided not to use that dataset.

The final [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekrp1517/online-retail-transactions-dataset) I landed seemed to have all the information I was looking for inluding item quantities purchases and transaction dates.
